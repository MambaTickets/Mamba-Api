# Mamba-Api
Base API of Mamba Tickets Application

## Run
This project runs locally at `port: 5555` by default, you can change at 
`src/main/resources/application.properties`.

### IntelliJ IDEA
I don't know why IDEA has so many problems with Java 11, so I need to change 
the Language Level to **8**
`File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Language Level`
, change `Java Compiler` to **8** version too. 

## Tests on SWAGGER

You need to access the following link, if you are running locally, to use Swagger interface 
`http://localhost:[port]/swagger-ui.html`
